# SpaceX Missions Explorer

## Description

This document contains additional context around the project (from a business perspective), as well as high level documentation for the technical implementation.

## Background

This project is a nice little side project where a user can visit a site (_coming soon_) and see past and upcoming missions, with the purpose of continuous learning, as it relates to the latest front end tech (e.g. `next.js`, see more below).

It is a work in progress, so that is why there are no link or screenshots just yet.
