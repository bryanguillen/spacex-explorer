# SpaceX Missions Explorer

## Background

This project is a nice little side project where a user can visit a site and see past missions for SpaceX.  The reason for this is that I just wanted to have some fun by writing some code to grow and stay sharp with fundamentals.

## Project Overview

### Technical Overview

Now, rather than have a typical `README.md`, I actually went ahead and created a blog post that contains a video where I demo the project and also discuss the architecture/implementation at a high level.  Please checkout the video [here](https://bryg217.github.io/bryans-blog/posts/5-next-js-app-architecture/).

### Link

The app has been deployed using Netlify; see the app [here](https://zen-lumiere-da734a.netlify.app/).

### Caution

**Note: It seems like the API is out of date.  It works, but the data returned is from 2020 and earlier.  For the link, see the next section.**
